3. Task Automation : to check whether each test cases are working, to ensure that the updated code is working
4. Provide Structured lifecycle: 
	- adding feature
	- compile
	- run all the test methods
	- Create executable

**Problems solved by this build tools:
- reduce complexity in compilation
- reduce inconsistencies
- reduce repetitive tasks

Build Tools
1. Gradle
2. Maven
3. Ant

create branch buildtool 

one example of pull, cherry-pick
